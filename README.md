Student Management System – Java & MySQL (JDBC CRUD Project)

Developed a console-based Java application implementing complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records using JDBC.

Designed and executed parameterized SQL queries using PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection and ensure secure database access.

Implemented menu-driven user interaction using Scanner and control structures for smooth user flow.

Connected Java application to MySQL database using DriverManager and handled database operations efficiently.

Used ResultSet to retrieve and display student data dynamically from the database.

Applied exception handling (try-catch, SQLException) to manage runtime and database errors gracefully.

Followed modular programming by separating logic into reusable methods for better readability and maintainability.

Tech Stack: Core Java, JDBC, MySQL, SQL, Git
